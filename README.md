## Books

### 1. Solving Havana Syndrome and Biological Effects of RF Using the Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Model

**Author:** Clint McLean
**Publisher:** McLean Research Institute
**Copyright:** © 2022
**ISBN:** 978-0-6397-2006-7 (ebook)

A scientifically rigorous exploration of how RF (Radio Frequency) radiation affects biological systems, specifically neural signaling. Uses the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to explain the mechanisms behind Havana Syndrome.

**Key Discovery:** Temperature changes as small as **0.0001°C** can affect neural signaling when amplified through neural networks.

**Key Topics:**
- Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model fundamentals
- Temperature-induced neural effects (Nernst equation)
- Four mechanisms: Threshold Inhibition, Spike Reduction, Rate Excitation, Anode Break
- Neural network amplification of RF effects
- Sub-thermal effects below safety standards

**Formats:** PDF, EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, DOCX, MD, HTML

**Location:** `01-Solving-Havana-Syndrome/`

### 2. Methods for Detecting Biology Affecting Electromagnetic Frequency Ranges Causing Havana Syndrome

**Author:** Clint McLean

Practical methodology for detecting electromagnetic frequencies that may affect human biology, using Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology and spectrum analysis.

**Key Topics:**
- SDR detection methodology with RTL-SDR (~$30)
- 433 MHz signal analysis
- Cazzamalli's historical research on brain radio signals
- Bio-radar principles
- Human resonant frequencies (400 MHz adult head, 700 MHz baby head)
- Equipment setup and configuration

**Formats:** PDF, EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, DOCX, MD, HTML

**Location:** `02-Methods-for-Detecting/`

| Current safety threshold | +1°C |
| McLean's minimum effect | **+0.0001°C** |
| Adult head resonance | ~400 MHz |
| Baby head resonance | ~700 MHz |
| Neurons in error at +0.01°C | >20% |
| Detection equipment cost | ~$30 |
