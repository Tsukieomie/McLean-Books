### [0:00 - 0:30] Introduction

This video demonstrates the actual frequencies that were used for electronic harassment. These frequencies were used for biological effects and also transmission of EEG data for remote neural monitoring (RNM).

It's essentially guaranteed that you haven't seen anything like this. It's also more significant of course in biology effects and RNM. And researches that of MRIs through the wall radar.

This was the frequency range detected that is in the human head's resonant frequency range, for an adult from 400 to 500 megahertz. So it doesn't reflect on the surface or near the surface of us.

---

### [0:30 - 1:00] The Science of Resonant Frequencies

These longer wavelength frequency ranges resonate within us. So they will cause known biological effects and also be reradiated with EEG data.

Research from Wang et al of 2019 and Li et al of 2014 proves this occurs because EEG electrical activity affects our antenna qualities. So it modifies or modulates the reradiated waves in strength and phase.

---

### [1:00 - 1:30] Detection Methodology

This video demonstrates that the detection of these frequencies that receive and reradiate is achievable. And using just a basic RTL-SDR device with code that I wrote to use it as a spectrum analyzer to detect these frequencies.

I know what this is - that form of signal that could do this is an electromagnetic signal. And these signals are detectable because they have to always be there. And they would be stronger when we're near an antenna or in the scanning region of a directional antenna.

---

### [1:30 - 2:00] Software Demonstration

The spectrum analyzer code system shows a signal that detected the reradiated with significant amounts of electrical energy. And according to the research of Wang et al and Li et al, these signals will be reradiated with the EEG data.

This code also uses 3D graphics so I can rotate and view the graphs in 3D.

---

### [2:00 - 2:40] Software Functionality

Although this code system has a lot of other functionality, I'm just going to demonstrate the essential functionality. Do you take the reradiated energy?

This graph shows the reach values - the frequency range of strength over time. And can also be zoomed in on specific frequency ranges and signals.

---

### [2:40 - 3:20] Signal Strength Analysis

And the graph shows the strength of frequency range over time. This is how we detect reradiated waves of energy from ourselves.

It increases when we're near the antenna or in the scanning region of a directional antenna. Then we know the extra energy is from us.

This is the equipment used. There's a notebook with all this stuff loaded into it, connected.

---

### [3:20 - 4:00] Equipment Setup

Yeah, you enter the notebook supporting cameras area where I'll be staying.

This is from where I'm standing - about 10 meters away from the detection equipment. Around 10 meters. Original signal since you can't point the yagi close to where the tree is.

Satellite bodies also in this region, so it could be from a satellite although it's also software entirely in the same direction. Signal will be transferred towards me and then reradiated back towards the yagi antenna.

---

### [4:00 - 4:30] Recording Setup

There's a record in the notebook screen and camera for experiment. Remember the camera's pointing where the audio antenna is also pointing - at the scanning regions check the electronic energy from me.

I'll watch the strong response of the signal strength graph - the red line - when I get into the detection region.

---

### [4:30 - 5:00] Detection Demonstration

And when I move out of it, it suddenly decreases.

*[Demonstration of entering and exiting the detection region, with visible changes in signal strength on the graph]*

---

### [5:00 - 8:51] Extended Demonstration & Discussion

*[The video continues with further demonstrations of signal detection, showing the correlation between the subject's position relative to the antenna and the measured signal strength. The 3D visualization software displays real-time changes in the frequency spectrum.]*

Key observations demonstrated:
- Signal strength increases when subject enters the antenna's scanning region
- Signal strength decreases when subject moves away
- Detection is achievable from approximately 10 meters distance
- The frequency range corresponds to human head resonant frequencies (400-500 MHz)

## Video Description (Original)

This video demonstrates the detection of frequencies ranges used for electronic harassment.

These frequencies would be used for causing biological effects and also the transmission of EEG data for remote neural monitoring (RNM) and it's been shown that there's significant information in EEG data (Nemrodov et al, 2018).

It's essentially guaranteed that you haven't seen anything like this, the detection of frequencies from around 10 meters from a detector.

The frequency range detected is in the human head's resonant frequency range, for an adult from 400 to 500 MHz (ARRL Handbook, 1992).

So it doesn't reflect off the surface or near the surface of us and these longer wavelength frequency ranges resonate within us and so could cause significant biological effects and would also be reradiated with EEG data.

Research from Wang et al (2019) and Li et al (2014) proves that such signals reradiate EEG data because the mind's electrical activity affects our antenna qualities and so modifies or modulates the reradiated waves in strength and phase.

The idea with detecting these signals then is that for RNM to occur a signal has to get from us to the perpetrator and the only known form of signal that could do this is an electromagnetic signal and these signals are detectable because they have to always be there and they would be stronger when we're nearer an antenna or in the scanning region of a directional antenna.

The detection of these frequencies is achievable using a basic RTL-SDR device with code that I wrote to use it as a spectrum analyzer to detect these frequencies.
