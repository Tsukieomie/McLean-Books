This video demonstrates the detection of frequencies that would be used for electronic harassment.

These frequencies would be used for causing biological effects and also the transmission of EEG data for remote neural monitoring (RNM).

It's essentially guaranteed that you haven't seen anything like this. It's also more significant for causing biological effects and RNM than research such as that of MIT's through the wall radar.

This is because the frequency range that I've detected is in the human head's resonant frequency range, for an adult from 400 to 500 MHz. So it doesn't reflect off the surface or near the surface of us.

These longer wavelength frequency ranges resonate within us and so could cause significant biological effects and would also be reradiated with EEG data.

Research from Wang et al of 2019 and Li et al of 2014 proves that this occurs because EEG electrical activity affects our antenna qualities and so modifies or modulates the reradiated waves in strength and phase.

This video demonstrates that the detection of these frequencies that we receive and reradiate is achievable using a basic rtl sdr device with code that I wrote to use it as a spectrum analyzer to detect these frequencies.

The idea with this is that for RNM to occur a signal has to get from us to the perpetrator and the only known form of signal that could do this is an electromagnetic signal and these signals are detectable because they have to always be there and they would be stronger when we're nearer an antenna or in the scanning region of a directional antenna.

This graph from the code system shows a signal that I detected that I reradiate with significant amounts of electromagnetic energy and according to the research of Wang et al and Li et al these signals would be reradiated with EEG data for RNM.

This code also uses 3D graphics so I can rotate and view the graphs in 3D.

Although this code system has a lot of other functionality I'm now just going to demonstrate the essential functionality here to detect the reradiated energy.

This graph shows the average values of the frequency range's strength over time and can also be zoomed in on to specific frequency ranges and signals.

And this graph shows the strength of the selected range over time. This is how we detect the reradiated electromagnetic wave energy from ourselves. If it increases when we're near the antenna or in the scanning region of a directional antenna then we know the extra energy is from us.

This is the equipment used, just a notebook with the rtl sdr plugged into it and connected to the yagi directional antenna.

The yagi antenna and the notebooks built in camera is pointing towards the area where I'll be standing.

This is from where I'm standing, reasonably far away from the detection equipment, around 10 meters. The origin of the signal seems to be from a point in the sky close to where the tree is. The geostationary satellite belt is also in this region, so it could be from a satellite, although there is also a cell phone tower in the same direction.

So the signal would be transmitted towards me and then reradiated back towards the yagi antenna.

This is a recording of the notebooks screen and camera for the experiment. Remember the camera is pointing where the yagi antenna is also pointing, a scanning region to detect the electromagnetic energy from me.

Now watch the strong response of the signal strength graph, the red line, when I get into the detection region.

…. and when I move out of it it suddenly decreases

….and again the strong response when moving into it

This is a very significant increase in strength and means that this signal, with just the basic rtl sdr equipment, could be detectable from a lot further away.

Now think of the videos you've seen where someone uses an RF energy or frequency detector device and moves it close to them and a little light turns on or it makes a noise indicating that it's detecting something.

I don't mean to reduce the significance of their findings, however this is from 10 meters away and so clearly demonstrating that these signals would travel over reasonably far ranges.

Now I'll try something different.

See how sensitive it is to movements in the detection region. It's not necessarily that it's not detecting energy from me when I move just a little further from the main detection region, although it is detecting a lot less.

This shows just how sensitive a basic rtl sdr used as a detector is to movements and this is from 10 meters away.

Although perps generally don't use these signals for through the wall radar and tracking, it shows that these signals could also be used for this.

Since there is significant information in EEG, they mostly just use your EEG data.

Other research shows that images that you're thinking of can be determined and also reconstructed just from it.

So this proves that we reradiate certain frequency ranges that could cause biological effects and transmit EEG data for RNM and each of us has our own individual resonant frequency range, this is established electromagnetic wave antenna science.

Ham radio users are warned about transmitting in these resonant frequency ranges, with each of us tuned to our own specific frequencies where we receive the most electromagnetic energy and also reradiate the most electromagnetic energy.

This means that we're receivers and transmitters at certain frequency ranges and that we can detect these.

Although all the signals in these ranges aren't necessarily being intentionally used for this, the frequency ranges themselves would be.

So what you've got to do is first find your resonant frequency and then we can do further research to determine if someone is intentionally transmitting on it to cause biological effects and for RNM.

So if you hear someone saying that the frequencies used aren't detectable they're either ignorant or they're lying. It's a strategy of the perps to get so called "RF engineers" infiltrated into us to say that they're not detectable or that the equipment will cost millions of dollars.

I find it very interesting that some of these so called engineers aren't doing any actual research or they're just working on gimmicks and if they do say that they're doing research and have equipment then they try to create the idea that the actual legitimate scientific research won't work to try to persuade others away from the answers.

There are at least several of these so called engineers, they're just used to try and control our research.

Think, perps know that if we research this that we'll find an answer, so they try to infiltrate and say that it won't work when we already know scientifically that it will.

Others see you because you reflect or reradiate light. These signals though don't reflect off of the surface of us, so they reradiate with EEG data from within. This is how perps "see" us.

Clearly what I have achieved here is very significant, this is how biological effects would be caused, since these signals cause and affect biological electrical currents and are also reradiated with EEG data for RNM.

There's got to be a signal that get's from us to the perps. This then is proof that such signals are detectable and would be used for electronic harassment.

> Took me two years to find your channel, in spite of trying everything I could think of to research the surveillance tech the Perps are using. It wasn't until I used "Electronic Harassment" as a Google search and I didn't even find your video then - YouTube just suggested it after about 48 hour delay. I have on my To-Do list: "Return to Signal" to try to identify the Perps or at least prove their actions.
>
> One thing I have learned is that you can set up a PoE only Reolink 8 Megapixel Security Camera system and use that to see ghostly images of their Hyperspectral or Multispectral Imaging system spy camera images - for example the covert bathroom "toiletbowl cam" images (by zooming in a on nearby outdoor reflective surfaces such as parked car rearview mirrors or windows with the Reolink security camera). This is without the PoE cameras connected to anything except the NVR itself and with no internet connection to the cameras or the NVR.
>
> I have not figured out if the Reolink security camera system is picking up their covert spycam imagery by itself or if the Perps have hijacked my own security camera system and are using it to store their own spycam imagery. In their system, there is no lens or imaging device needed at the location spied upon - it seems it is done with a mesh network, a millimeter GPS and something that makes my EMF Meter spike up to 60 to over 100 volts per square meter any time I physically make a motion inside my home.

> All other EMF Meter readings are nominal with their surveillance and harassment system in use, this would be on on the GQ Electronics meters such as GQ-EMF 380, the GQ-EMF390 and the GQ-GMC-600+ (Geiger-Muller Meter), as well as the TriField EMF Meter the one with the Chickenhead knob. The spike is in the "EF" setting and shows a mixed signal the bulk of which is 120 Volt 60 Hertz household wiring, but apparently with an injected signal, possibly with a Ethernet over Powerline somehow installed on my powerlines.
